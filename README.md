# Catch the Falling Objects Game ðŸŽ®

A simple, fun browser-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to catch as many falling objects as possible by moving a character side-to-side. The game tracks your score, which increases each time you successfully catch an object!

## How to Play

1. **Move the Character**: Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** on your keyboard to move the character at the bottom of the game area.
2. **Catch Falling Objects**: Try to position the character under the falling objects to "catch" them. Each successful catch adds 1 point to your score.
3. **Avoid Missing**: If an object reaches the bottom without being caught, it resets, and you miss out on that point. The game is endless, so keep going to get the highest score possible!
